In an interview, Dragan Mitrovic, AVL Specialist at Cityneon’s Events Department, expressed the importance of the innovative edge and timely delivery of Absen’s products and services in affecting the company’s decision. “Timing in that moment was our biggest challenge,” said Mitrovic, expressing satisfaction with Absen’s three-month delivery period. Additionally, he has emphasized the exceptional design and features of the PL V2 Series. With pixel pitches ranging from 1.9mm to 4.8mm and brightness levels up to 4500 nits, these screens provide unparalleled clarity and performance in both indoor and outdoor settings. User-friendly functions include automatic edge protection, reliable lock systems, modular maintenance, and magnet-assisted assembly for easy installation. Its flexible mounting options, including curved displays and mixed connections, make the PL V2 Series adaptable and ideal for diverse applications.
